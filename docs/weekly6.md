# Weekly report 6

6.-11.10.

time spent: 25 hours

## What did I do this week?
- functions
- parenthesis
- error handling
- jacoco reporting, adding more tests
- propagating errors to the user
- recognising invalid variable names
- recognising evaluation errors
- documenting code
- testing document
- implementation document
- manual updated
- UI updated

## How did the project advance?
The project has now all the expected functionality and required documentation.  
The code is tested and tidied up, ready for review. 

## What did I learn?
Parametrized tests in JUnit 5 are very nice.  
Unary minus is kind of tricky.  

## Anything difficult or unclear?  


## What next?  
I would consider this project ready now. I will probably do 
little more testing and bug hunting, and will add improvements 
based on the next peer review.
