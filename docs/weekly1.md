# Weekly report 1

3.-7.9.

time spent: 15 hours

## What did I do this week?
- Attended the starting lecture
- Set up the project
  - maven project
  - github project
  - made a simple text inteface for the program
  - registered in labtool
- Understanding the shunting yard algorithm
  - read about it
  - simulating with different inputs
- Thinking of the structure of the program
  - a tokenizer
  - a parser
  - an evaluator

## How did the project advance?
The project has now a simple text interface, 
which at this point doesn't do anything useful. 
I have some idea of how the program will be 
structured, but it is not reflected in the code. 

## What did I learn?
I learned about the shunting yard algorithm, and about parsers generally. 
I have not done anything involving parsers before. I noticed that some of my 
concerns about how complicated the program would be were from imagining 
how to parse with a context, but then learned that all the parsing needed 
in this project is context-free. 

## Anything difficult or unclear?
Only my own time management, but I think it'll be ok.

## What next?
Next week I plan to put in code the structure I have so far imagined, and make 
the program work from end to end with the simplest inputs, probably 
just the basic arithmetics. I will also get started with unit testing as I go.
