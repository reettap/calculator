time spent: 15 hours

## What did I do this week?
- Peer review + improvements based on the peer review
- wrote the proper tokenizer 
- wrote manual and made UI improvements
- unary minus 
- variables functionality

## How did the project advance?
The project has now the majority of the final functionality.

## What did I learn?
- I had completely missed some of the details in the wikipedia article -- 
there is a class of invalid expressions that I will probably just mark as a limitation on this 
project. 
-  I learned about handling the different roles of minus - the unary minus and the subtraction

## Anything difficult or unclear?


## What next?
I will try to get the project as close to done as possible. 

- functions
- parenthesis
- recognising invalid expressions
- documentation
- more testing
