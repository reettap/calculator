# Project Specification

## Project
A function calculator [as described in the example projects](https://algolabra-hy.github.io/aiheet#tieteellinen-laskin). 

This calculator is a Java command line program. It takes mathematical 
expressions as an input, and responds with either the result or 
a specific error message. 

The calculator can handle basic arithmetics, variables, functions with one 
parameter such as sqrt and sin, and functions with two parameters such as 
min and max. 

The calculator uses the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), 
which has space and time complexity of O(n). 
The core problem to be solved in this project is the 
parsing of the expression and recognising various types of invalid expressions.
